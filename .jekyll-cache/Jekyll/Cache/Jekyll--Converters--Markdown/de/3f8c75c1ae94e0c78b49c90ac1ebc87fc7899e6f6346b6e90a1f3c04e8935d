I"ì<p>In this post we will explore how to implement an IR Emitter using a microcontroller, in this case a <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC10F322">PIC10F322</a>. I chose this microcontroller because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Itâ€™s cheap</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s tiny</li>
  <li>It has a PWM, which will be very useful in creating the carrier signal</li>
</ul>

<p>After finishing the firmware, I saw that I could have chosen something even smaller but I wanted to err on the safe side. Shipping isnâ€™t free! (i actually had a coupon and it was).</p>

<p>This project is meant to be complimentary with an USB IR Receiver which is still a Work in Progress, aimed at controlling my computer from a distance while watching movies; for example to pause it or change the volume.</p>
